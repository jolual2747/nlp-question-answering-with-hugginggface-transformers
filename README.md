# Question Answering with Fine-Tuning Project

## Overview

This project demonstrates Question Answering (QA) with Fine-Tuning using the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD) from the original source. It aims to provide a simple guide on how to fine-tune a transformer-based model for QA tasks using custom datasets.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/qa-fine-tuning-project.git
   cd qa-fine-tuning-project
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Fine-tuning

-Use the fine-tuning.ipynb notebook to fine-tune your transformer-based model on the custom SQuAD dataset.
-You can modify hyperparameters and experiment with different models.
